## FIRA MiroSot Game Rules For Middle League and Large League ##
### 1.1.1  Playground Surface and Dimension ###
A black (non-reflective) flat and hard rectangular playground 220 cm x 180 cm (Middle League) or 400 x 280 cm (Large League) in size with 5 cm high and 2.5 cm thick white side-walls will be used. The playground is considered flat if a ball placed anywhere on the field does not start to roll. There should be no edges (such as through tape markings or gaps) on the playground. The topsides of the side-walls should be black in color with the interior walls painted in white (side view).
Solid 7 cm x 7 cm isosceles triangles are to be fixed at the four corners of the playground to avoid the ball getting cornered.
The surface texture of the board should be like a ping pong table. It should provide sufficient grip.


### 1.1.2  Markings On The Playground ###
The field of play should be marked as shown in Appendix A. The center circle will have a radius of 25 (Middle League) or 75 cm (Large League).
All lines and marks should be white in color and 3 mm thick.
(Middle League only)
The arc will be 25 cm along the goal line and 5 cm perpendicular to it.

### 1.1.3  The Goal ###
The goal is 40 (Middle League) or 60 cm (Large League) wide. There are no posts or nets at the goal.

### 1.1.6  The Ball ###
An orange golf ball shall be used as the ball, with 42.7 mm diameter and 46 g weight.

### 1.1.7  The Field Location ###
The field should be indoors.

### 1.2  Vision And Lighting ###
1. The lighting conditions should be more than 500 Lux anywhere on the playground. The lighting should be diffuse and evenly distributed. A flicker free lighting is recommended.

2. In order to identify the robots and the ball on the playground, a vision system can be used. In Middle League, only one camera per team may be used. This limit does not apply to Large League.

3. In case only one camera is used, the location of a team's camera or sensor system should be restricted to over and above their own half of the field including the center line, so that the camera need not to be moved after the side change at halftime. If both teams wish to keep their cameras over and above the center circle of the playground, they shall be placed side by side, equidistant from the centerline and as close to each other as possible. The location of the overhead camera or sensor system should be at a height of 2.5 m (Middle League) or 3 m (Large League).

4. In case a team uses more than one camera the team should inform the organizers about the mounting position and height of the camera to prepare the camera fixture.
### 2.2  The Robots ###
1. The size of each robot is limited to 7.5 cm x 7.5 cm x 7.5 cm. The height of the RF communication antenna will not be considered in deciding a robot's size. The robots are allowed to equip with arms, legs etc., but they must comply with the size restrictions even with the appendages fully expanded.

3. To enable infrared sensing a robot's sides should be colored light, except at regions necessarily used for robot functionality, such as those for sensors, wheels or a ball catching mechanism.

4. The robots should wear uniforms and the size of these is limited to 8 cm x 8 cm x 8 cm. These uniforms may not have other functions than to protect the robot and to carry the team patch. The robot must be fully functional without the uniform and it must be easily detachable.

6. None of the robots, except the single goalkeeper, should be allowed to catch or hold the ball such that more than 30% of the ball is out of view either from the top or from the sides (Appendix C).

### 2.2.1  Patches ###
The topside of a robot must not be colored in orange. A color patch either blue or yellow, as assigned by the organizers per Rule 3.2.1, will identify the robots in a team. All robots must have (at least) a 3.5 cm x 3.5 cm solid region of their team color patch, blue or yellow, visible on their top. A team's identification color might change from game to game, and the team color patch used should be detachable. When assigned with one of the two team colors the robots must not have any visible patches of those or similar colors used by an opponent team.

### Appendix I  Recommendations For The Organizers ###
#### Lighting ####
Special care should be taken of the lighting of the fields. Avoid lighting with bright spots on the field (a small number of powerful halogen lights, for example). The best solution are usually fluorescent lamps directly above the field, but be aware that these a) might not be bright enough and b) are out the box not flicker-free and therefore unsuitable for some teams. Because of that ample fluorescent lamps - flicker-free (100 Hz or above) - are recommended.
#### The Field ####
It is important that the field is in good condition and that it is build exactly to the specifications of the rules. It is very helpful for game-play if the field is non-reflective and has a surface texture with high grip. A surface paint that has proven to be suitable is blackboard paint.
